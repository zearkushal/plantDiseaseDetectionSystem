            Our system is developed using an advanced machine learning model designed specifically for plant disease detection. Machine learning enables the system to analyze vast amounts of data, learn from it, and make highly accurate predictions. By training the model on thousands of labeled plant images, it has gained the ability to recognize patterns, textures, and color variations associated with different plant diseases. This ensures that the system can detect diseases with remarkable precision, even when the symptoms are subtle. Our machine learning approach not only enhances the accuracy of disease identification but also makes the process faster and more reliable, empowering farmers and gardeners to take timely action to protect their crops and plants.

              We the students of Everest College, Thapathali, have collaborated for the development of this project. Everest College, a truly management college, centrally located at Thapathali, Kathmandu, has been consistent in its approach to assist management students to shape habits, skills, interest, psychology not only nurturing their managerial excellence but also ensuring and inspiring them for existential life being a part of society. Everest College has been solely convinced with a destination of fostering and foregrounding the academics of present education system flavouring new ideas and strategies to meet pace with the fast changing pattern and cope with the global challenges and needs.
